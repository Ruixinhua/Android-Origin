Over a long period of time,#denser matter attracted nearby matter#thus forming gas, stars and galaxies
Some observations and theory suggest#the first quasars and galaxies formed#about a billion years after the Big Bang
The galaxies was partitioned into#elliptical,normal spiral,and irregulars#barred spiral(such as the Milky Way)
An elliptical galaxy is a type of#galaxy having an ellipsoidal shape#and a smooth, nearly featureless image.
Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat#rotating disk containing stars,gas,dust#and a central concentration of stars
The Milky Way is the galaxy#that contains our Solar System#It is a kind of barred spiral galaxy
An irregular galaxy is a galaxy#that not have a distinct regular shape#they are often chaotic in appearance
A compact site of star formation is#the opaque clouds of dense gas#and dust known as Bok globules
There are two main stages of evolution.#The first is due to the super massive#growing by accreting cooling gas.
The second stage is marked by#stabilizing by suppressing gas cooling#thus leaving in a stable state
