The Big Bang theory is trying to#explain what happened of our universe#at the very beginning of time.
Discoveries in astronomy and physics#have shown reasonable doubt#that our universe have a beginning
Our universe at the beginning#sprang into "singularity"#around 13.7 billion years ago.
What is a "singularity"?#Where does it come from?#Well, we don't know for sure.
Singularities are zones which#defy our understanding of physics.#Maybe exist at the core of "black holes"
Black holes are areas of thought of#intense gravitational pressure.#Finite matter press in infinite density
It is infinitesimally(very very) small#It is infinitely(very very) hot#It is infinitely(very very) dense
